# Netflix Subscriptions Forecasting

Project Type: Time Series Forecasting

Project Summary:
Developed a time series forecasting model to predict quarterly subscription growth for Netflix. This project involved the use of various data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis, and ARIMA modeling to generate accurate forecasts. The main objective was to enable Netflix to optimize resource planning and strategic decision-making based on predicted subscription trends.

Key Steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

* Gathered historical Netflix subscription data from 2013 to 2023.
* Converted time periods to datetime format for accurate time series analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Visualized quarterly subscription growth using line plots.
* Analyzed quarterly and yearly growth rates to understand subscription trends.

3. Time Series Modeling:

* Utilized ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for forecasting.
* Determined the model parameters (p, d, q) using ACF (AutoCorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial AutoCorrelation Function) plots.
* Trained the ARIMA model on the historical subscription data.

4. Forecasting and Visualization:

* Generated forecasts for the next five quarters.
* Visualized the original and forecasted subscription counts using interactive plots.

Tools and Technologies:

Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, statsmodels

Key Insights:

* Provided accurate forecasts for Netflix subscription growth.
* Enabled data-driven decision-making for resource allocation and strategic planning.
* Identified and visualized trends in subscription growth over time.

Outcome:

Successfully built a robust forecasting model that can predict future subscription counts, aiding Netflix in better understanding and planning for subscriber growth. The project demonstrates the application of time series forecasting techniques to real-world business scenarios, emphasizing the importance of predictive analytics in strategic planning.
